                    The choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest
                    financial decisions that many adults make. But the costs of buying are more varied
                    and complicated than for renting, making it hard to tell which is a better deal.
                    To help you answer this question, our calculator takes the most important costs
                    associated with buying a house and compares it to renting in cash values.
